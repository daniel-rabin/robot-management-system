🔍 Potential Competitors
Robot Operating System (ROS) – Great backend, not user-friendly

RoboDK / VPL – Industrial robots only, $$$

MyRobotLab – Open-source, but outdated UX

Niryo One Studio / Dobot Studio – Product-specific

Viam – Modern but cloud-first

Our advantage? Cross-device, desktop-first, clean UI, with strong modularity.
